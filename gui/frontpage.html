  <p class="lead">Maldy is a portable data driven framework developed for security investigators which works as plug and play model. It is easy to use and efficient</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>It uses behavioural report generated by various analysing tools to check for bening or malware characteristic of the applications. Application from any platform android or windows can be analysed. Malware investigation is an important, time consuming and due to the diversity of malware it is more tedious for security investigators. The diversity of malware needs to adopt portable tools and techniques for malware detection and threat attribution. Various tools are available for malware detection such as static analysis, dynamic analysis of binary code. However, the use of static analysis could be problematic for heavily obfuscated malware and is platform dependent. These issues however have been addressed partly and covers simple evading techniques. The dynamic analysis solutions on the other hand show more robustness towards the evading techniques such as obfuscation and packing. However, the drawback of dynamic solutions is that it consumes many computational resources and can be worked by anti-emulation techniques. Anti-emulation techniques are however less than obfuscation and packing techniques. For this reason, dynamic analysis is still the default choice for malware analysis. Static and behavior analysis are sources for security features use to decide maliciousness of a given program. Manual inspection of these features is a tedious task. For this reason, it can be automated using ML techniques supervised or unsupervised. The supervised ML starts by training a classification model on train-set and afterwards is use on new samples. Unsupervised learning is however more common in malware family clustering but is less common in malware detection. Here emphasis is on supervised ML techniques along with behavior or dynamic analysis to investigate malicious software. </p>
